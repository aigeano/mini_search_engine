'''Pine Village''' is a town in [[Adams Township, Warren County, Indiana|Adams Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The population was 255 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Pine Village is located at the intersection of [[Indiana State Road 55|State Road 55]] and [[Indiana State Road 26|State Road 26]], near [[Big Pine Creek (Indiana)|Big Pine Creek]].{{GR|1}}  It is about {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and about {{convert|14|mi}} east of the [[Illinois]] border.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.126|sqmi}}, all of it land.

==History==
The town was founded at the location of a trading post called Pine Village, which may have been named for a lone pine tree that stood on the bluff of Pine Creek, or it may have been named for the creek itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town was laid out in 1851 by Isaac and John R. Metsker, and the plat map was made by county surveyor Perrin Kent.  The Methodist Church was already there; it was built several years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Rail service===
Rail service reached the town in the 1870s.  The year 1883 witnessed the completion of a north/south [[Chicago and Great Southern Railway]] (later the [[Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway]]) line between [[Attica, Indiana|Attica]] and [[Fair Oaks, Indiana|Fair Oaks]], which subsequently came under the ownership of the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad]].  The line came to be known as the &quot;Coal Road&quot; for the large quantities of [[coal]] transported along it.  When the C&amp;EI floundered in the early 1920s, Charles F. Propst purchased the Coal Road and in October 1922 incorporated it as the [[Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad]].  The CA&amp;S was placed in [[receivership]] on August 5, 1931, and incremental abandonment occurred over subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The area on the east side of Pine Village near the railroad, consisting of a grain elevator and some homes, was known as Oklahoma&lt;ref name=&quot;awapv&quot; /&gt; and is located at {{coord|40|26|59|N|87|14|42|W|type:landmark_region:US-IN|name=Oklahoma}}.

===Football===
From a historical marker entitled &quot;Pine Village Football&quot;, located near the town fire station: &lt;blockquote&gt;Local team was important Indiana precursor to modern professional [[American football|football]] organizations.  Clinton Beckett introduced football to Pine Village High School 1898. Town and high school teams played on bottomland, northwest of here, starting local football tradition. Town team, the Villagers, managed by C.J. Shackleton and later by Claire Rhode. Team became &quot;professional&quot; 1915, claiming state and regional championships. Jim Thorpe, All-American, played for Villagers in 1915 Thanksgiving Day game against [[Purdue University|Purdue]] All-Stars: Villagers won 29 to 0. Team was a founder of Indiana Football League 1917. Following World War I, the Villagers played intermittently until 1927.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''State Line City''' is a town in [[Kent Township, Warren County, Indiana|Kent Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]], located along the state's border with [[Illinois]].  As of the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]], the town population was 141.  The small section of town that protrudes west across the border is formally known as [[Illiana, Illinois]].

==History==
[[Image:State Line Lincoln marker.png|thumb|left|150px|A marker commemorates [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s speech.]]
In the mid-1850s, two large railway lines converged on the Indiana-Illinois state line – the narrow-gauge [[Wabash Valley Railroad]], whose route from the east crossed Warren County and reached the border in October 1856, and the standard-gauge [[Great Western Railroad (Illinois)|Great Western Railroad]], which shortly thereafter reached the state line from the west.  State Line City was platted on June 29, 1857 by Robert Casement at the convergence of these two railroads.  The city flourished, and within 10 years had reached a population of approximately 550, but because of the drinking and carousing of the numerous railroaders it gained an unsavory reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;hwc&quot;&gt;{{cite book

On February 11, 1861, [[Abraham Lincoln]] stopped in State Line on his way from [[Springfield, Illinois]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] for his inauguration.  He dined at the Frazier Eating House, then gave a short speech to a crowd in the public square before resuming his journey.  A historical marker on the site commemorates the event.

[[Image:State Line City Indiana map from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|150px|Map from 1877 atlas]]
The town's post office was established in July 1857, with Robert Casement as the first postmaster, and continues to operate today from a newer building on Woodard Street.  Grain elevators were erected in the fall of 1857, but fires in September 1900, December 1932 and June 1984 each completely destroyed the structures, which were subsequently rebuilt.  State Line's grain elevators are currently operated by [[Archer Daniels Midland]] of [[Decatur, Illinois]], and see considerable activity during harvest time.  The town's other large business is a fertilizer and agricultural sales facility northeast of town, built in 1975 and currently operated by Westland Co-Op. 

[[Image:State Line Palmer House.png|thumb|left|150px|The Palmer House, originally an [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] hall.]]
Other establishments in State Line include the Kent Township Fire Department, formed in 1978, which took over local fire protection responsibilities from the West Lebanon Fire Department; in 2000, however, the department merged back with West Lebanon, which now maintains the State Line fire station.  The KTFD sponsored for a number of years an annual town festival called the State Line Fun Days, but this is no longer held.  

As of 2007, State Line houses one active church: the State Line Christian Church, built in 1868.  Rev. Gerald Burt has been the pastor there since 1972.  The Church of the Nazarene (built around 1860 as a Presbyterian church and purchased for use as a Nazarene church in 1929) and the Methodist Church (built in 1863-4) were both disbanded due to low attendance in the 1990s and have since been turned into homes.  Rev. Jim Kessler was the last pastor at the Nazarene church.

==Geography==
State Line City is located in the southwestern part of the county in open farm land along the border with Illinois, five miles northeast of the city of [[Danville, Illinois|Danville]].  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.135|sqmi}}, all of it land.

The [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] runs southwest through town.  For many years the famous [[Wabash Cannonball]] ran on the line (then owned by the Wabash Railway), passing through town twice a day on its route from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and back.  The Wabash Railway merged in the mid 1960s with the Norfolk and Western Railway, which in turn merged with Southern Railway in the 1980s to become Norfolk Southern, officially bringing an end to the Wabash name.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 141 people, 54 households, and 36 families residing in the town. The [[population density]] was 1,046.9 people per square mile (418.8/km²). There were 56 housing units at an average density of 415.8/sq&amp;nbsp;mi (166.3/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 98.58% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.71% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.71% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]]. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.42% of the population.

There were 54 households out of which 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 1.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.5% were non-families. 27.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.27.

In the town the population was spread out with 28.4% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 32.6% from 25 to 44, 24.1% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 120.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $34,250, and the median income for a family was $41,607. Males had a median income of $30,625 versus $14,000 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $15,685. There were none of the families and 3.7% of the population living below the [[poverty line]], including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

'''West Lebanon''' is a town in [[Pike Township, Warren County, Indiana|Pike Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The population was 793 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[Image:West Lebanon, Indiana map from 1877 atlas.png|thumb|right|155px|Map from 1877 atlas]]
West Lebanon was laid out and [[plat]]ted in the fall of 1830 by Ebenezer Purviance, John G. Jemison and Andrew Fleming, and consisted of 64 lots.  Originally named Lebanon, the name was changed to West Lebanon in 1869 when the town was incorporated, possibly in deference to [[Lebanon, Indiana|the Boone County community of the same name]] which established its post office on December 15, 1832, just eleven days before their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not being close to any waterways, West Lebanon's early growth was relatively slow and for many years had no more than 20 families.  However, with the completion of the [[Wabash Railroad]] line one mile north of town in 1856, the community's fortunes improved and led to most of the town relocating closer to the station.  The original settlement area became known as Old Town.

'''Williamsport''' is a town in [[Washington Township, Warren County, Indiana|Washington Township]], [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The population was 1,935 at the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&amp;geo_id=&amp;_geoContext=&amp;_street=&amp;_county=williamsport&amp;_cityTown=williamsport&amp;_state=04000US18&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;show_2003_tab=&amp;redirect=Y|title=Census 2000 data for Williamsport|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Warren County, Indiana|Warren County]].{{GR|6}}  It is home to [[Williamsport Falls]], the highest waterfall in the state.

==History==
Williamsport was [[plat]]ted by (and named for) William Harrison on December 11, 1828,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Ronald L.|last2=Carmony|first2=Marvin|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1975|location=Bloomington, Indiana|title=Indiana Place Names|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the south end of the eastern fractional part of the northeast quarter of section 11, township 21, range 8.  Harrison was the first to occupy the town in the fall of 1828, building a log house at the east end of Main Street near the river, and operated a ferry crossing there for several years.  Though located on the opposite side of the river from the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]], Williamsport sought to draw shipping traffic by constructing a short cut-off canal.  Finished around 1852, the project led to the nickname &quot;Side-Cut City&quot;.

Williamsport became the county seat in June 1829, taking the title away from short-lived [[Warrenton, Indiana|Warrenton]].  Its post office was the first in the county and has operated since September 28, 1829.  The town was incorporated in March 1854, at which time its population was 552.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[James Frank Hanly]], who was the Governor of Indiana from 1905 to 1909, lived and practiced law here from 1879 to 1896; he is buried at [[List of cemeteries in Warren County, Indiana#Hillside|Hillside Cemetery]], on the northeast side of town.

The [[Williamsport-Washington Township Public Library]] opened in 1917 as a [[Carnegie library]], and moved to a new facility in 2002.

===Historic Places===
The Williamsport [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]] at 15 Fall Street, built in 1889, appears on the [[Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures]].  It was closed in 1964 and stood vacant until 1991, when a non-profit corporation was set up to support the restoration effort.  It was listed in 1998 after having received a new slate roof and other repairs.  The building contains the original stained glass windows, bell, pulpit, and pews.

The &quot;Tower House&quot; can be found at 303 Lincoln Street and was constructed in 1845.  The house was nicknamed due to its 3 story tower on the northeast corner of the building.  The house was originally constructed as a mirrored twin; the twin house was destroyed by a fire in the 1990s.  The house has changed from its original construction.  An enclosed front porch and side porch has been retooled to serve as the current family's kitchen area.  The house originally contained two large rooms upstairs, and three rooms downstairs.  What appears to be the summer kitchen and original carriage house still stand.  The house now has five bedrooms, one bath upstairs and seven rooms, an enclosed porch, and a bath downstairs.

The [[Warren County Courthouse (Indiana)|Warren County Courthouse]] at 125 North Monroe Street was built in 1907-1908 and is on the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It is the fourth purpose-built court house in the county's history.

==Geography==
Williamsport is located along [[Indiana State Road 28|State Road 28]] near the shores of the [[Wabash River]] which forms the eastern border of the county.  Its most striking natural feature is [[Williamsport Falls]], a 90-foot [[waterfall]] near the center of town and Indiana's tallest.  Williamsport's original section (&quot;Old Town&quot;) is in bottom land next to the river; &quot;New Town&quot; was built on the hill above it to be closer to the railroad.  The rail line through town is currently operated by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|1.05|sqmi}}, all of it land.

==History==
From 1100 to 1450 AD, a community of several thousand mound-building [[Angel Mounds|Mississippian culture people]] lived in the Newburgh area. No one knows why they left. John Sprinkle, a businessman of German descent, landed here in the spring of 1803, thirteen years before [[Indiana]] entered the Union as the 19th state. The community he founded became known as Sprinklesburg, and it was the first town in Warrick County. In 1837, the name of the town was changed to Newburgh. By 1850, Newburgh had grown to be one of the largest riverports on the Ohio-Mississippi River between [[Cincinnati]] and [[New Orleans]].

{{main article|Newburgh Raid}}
On July 18, 1862, Newburgh was the first town north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to be captured by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]. Colonel [[Adam Johnson (colonel)|Adam R. Johnson]], with a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] band, crossed the Ohio River and confiscated supplies and ammunition without a shot being fired. The Confederates would have been unable to shell the city (as promised) had Newburgh put up a fight. The Confederates' &quot;cannons&quot; were an assemblage of stove pipe, a charred log, and wagon wheels.

Newburgh grew steadily during the second half of the 20th Century with the increase of industry in the Evansville Metropolitan Area. Major area employers include Alcoa, Toyota Motors, Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Atlas Van Lines, the University of Evansville, and the University of Southern Indiana. Today, Newburgh boasts a lively historic district along with [[Castle High School (Indiana)|Castle High School]] that competes in statewide competitions in both athletics and academics.

On November 6, 2005, the [[Evansville Tornado of November 2005]] caused 25 deaths in nearby Evansville. Newburgh suffered extensive property damage and some injuries, but fortunately suffered no fatalities during the 2:06 AM tornado strike.

Each summer, Newburgh also hosts a number of festivals including the Fiddler Fest and the Strawberry Festival. Most are held on the shore of the river near to the town's lock and dam in the &quot;antique&quot; section of Newburgh.

In 2006, the [[United States Senior Men's Amateur Golf Championship]] was hosted in Newburgh at the [[Victoria National Golf Course]].

== History ==
The land for the town of New Pekin was first entered on August 25, 1818. The original town [[plat]] was made on December 23, 1883 by W. A. Graves. The town of New Pekin was incorporated in 1903 to provide funds to build and operate a school.

=== &quot;Old&quot; Pekin ===
On September 29, 1819, Isaac Davis entered section 30 in what was to become Polk Township. Several years later in 1831 Christian Bixler laid out the town of Pekin on the south side of [[Mutton Fork, Blue River]].

Before 1831, there were several buildings at this location. As early as 1830 stage coaches were making regular runs between [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]] and [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]]. A wagon route between [[Salem, Indiana|Salem]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]] also passed through this area. Pekin was a staging stop where horses were watered and changed.

The town prospered until 1851 when the railroad was completed. The train station was built on the more level north side of Blue River. Businesses gradually migrated to the new location. In 1854 the County Commissioners declared the town vacant and the area became known as Old Pekin.

=== Fourth of July Celebration ===
The town of New Pekin claims the distinction of having the oldest consecutive [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] celebration in the [[United States of America]]. Pekin began celebrating [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] in the year 1830. [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] claims to have celebrated since 1785.

Not too many historical facts about the earliest celebrations exist. The information available comes from oral tradition. The first several celebrations were said to be neighborhood affairs. It is assumed that it did not stay that way for long. Many families lived in the surrounding townships and there were not many social activities.

Various sources recount that the celebration was held near Old Pekin from 1830 until 1856. Around 1857 the celebration was moved to near the Blue River where festivities were held until 1885. In either 1872 or 1873 the picnic was held at the farm of James Campbell where he had built a recreational area.

The fall of 1884 saw the completion of the fairgrounds. The following year (1885), the celebration was moved to the new fairgrounds. Many local residents did not agree with the celebration being moved there and held a second celebration at Tash Grove.

In 1909, the Gill brothers bought the southern part of the old fairgrounds. It became known as Gill's Grove. This became the present location of the Pekin Community Park, where the celebration has been held every year since.

Today the celebration consists of a [[Fireworks|fireworks display]] a [[parade]], live bands, 3 on 3 [[basketball]] tournament, [[carnival]], food vendors, a [[flea market]], reading of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], prince &amp; princess [[competition|contest]], [[Horseshoes|Horseshoe Pitching Contest]], a queen contest, cookouts and many other small celebrations around the town of Pekin.

=== Morgan's Raid ===
On July 11, 1863, while crossing Blue River near New Pekin, Captain William J. Davis of [[Morgan's Raid]] and some of his men were captured by 73rd [[Indiana]] Volunteers and a detachment of the 5th U.S. Regulars. Captain Davis and several other soldiers were taken to [[New Albany, Indiana]] and secured in the county jail.

==History==
=== Morgan's Raid ===
In June 1863, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[cavalry]] under [[John Hunt Morgan]] had departed [[Tennessee]] on what would later became known as [[Morgan's Raid]]. Traveling through Tennessee and into Kentucky, Morgan eventually crossed into Indiana; he reached Salem on July 10, 1863, coming north from [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]]. Upon entering Salem at approximately 9 a.m., Morgan immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town. Morgan demanded taxes from the two [[flour mill]]s that belonged to DePauw and Knight, and from the Allen Wollen Mill. Morgan's men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.

Of the brief action at Salem, [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Basil W. Duke]], Morgan's second-in-command and brother-in-law, later said:

''&quot;They did not pillage with any sort of method or reason; it seemed to be a mania, senseless and purposeless. One man carried for two days a bird cage containing three [[canary|canaries]]. Another rode with a huge chafing dish on the pommel of his saddle. Although the weather was intensely warm, another slung seven pairs of [[skates]] around his neck. I saw very few articles of real value taken; they pillaged like boys robbing an [[orchard]].&quot;''

===Famous residents===
[[John Hay]], private secretary to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to Presidents [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was born in Salem and is generally known as Salem's most prominent citizen. A variety of museums and local buildings make reference to Mr. Hay's connections to the town.

Roy Robertson invented the process for making 2% [[milk]] while working at the Salem Creamery, where it was first produced and marketed. He was unable to obtain a patent and the invention was credited to someone else.

==Local Attractions==
Located in the center of Salem's town square, the Washington County Courthouse is generally known as Salem's most famous and recognizable landmark. The courthouse has historical placemarkers surrounding it, and at the southeastern corner of the grounds, there is a memorial to veterans killed in action during conflicts dating back to the [[Revolutionary War]].

Unusual for a town of this size is a large children's playground, &quot;Riley's Place&quot; at DePauw Park. Named after Riley Jean Tomlinson, a local toddler who accidentally drowned in a swimming pool, the park was built in 2001 and contains two- and three- story wooden castles and other structures for children's play (along with swings, slides, and similar playground equipment).

Every September, Salem celebrates &quot;Old Settler's Day&quot; at the [[John Hay Center]]. Set in a village of authentic log structures, the festival features historical re-enactments, as well as local arts and crafts.

Recently, Lake Salinda in Salem has been rumored to be home to the Salinda Serpent after reports were made about sightings of a giant snake in the lake. This information was reported by the Salem Leader in early June 2010.

Salem is also home to the legendary Salem Speedway. It is a half mile high banked paved oval that was first built in 1947. Many of the most legendary drivers of the past 50 years have raced there including Ted Horn, Parnelli Jones, AJ Foyt, Bobby and Al Unser, Mario Andretti, Larry Dickson, Darrell Waltrip and Jeff Gordon. AJ Foyt at one time held the world record for a half mile oval at the speedway. One of ESPN's first televised auto racing events was held there in 1979.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 1.0&amp;nbsp;square miles (2.7&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land.

== Notable Information ==
Cambridge City was platted on October 23, 1836 and celebrated its [[Sesquicentennial]] in 1986.  The town celebrates its history and heritage during the second weekend in each September during the annual Canal Days festival, which commemorates the importance of the [[Whitewater Canal]] to the formation and growth of Cambridge City in the 19th century.  Situated along the historic [[National Road]] (U.S. 40), Cambridge City is currently a prominent destination for antique seekers and is the home of many notable American figures including:

*'''Justin Youngs'''- Local meat cutter famous for throwing bologna &amp; an OG.  
*'''Buckskin Ben''' - a famous show business personality of the 1890s
*'''Jason Bunger''' - Was a manager of the girls Tennis team (1996-1999) for three teams (1997-1999) who went to Semi State, the most of any team in Lincoln High School sports history. He is also a founding owner of www.fvsports.com, one of the premier sports sites on the web. Jason was also one of the most dominant Wiffle Ball players in the State of Indiana.
*&quot;'''Single G'''&quot; - a world famous pacer who won many horse races during the Great Depression
*'''[[Solomon Meredith]]''' - a [[Quaker]] general in the [[American Civil War]]
*'''The [[Overbeck Sisters]]''' - four daughters of John and Sarah Overpeck who hand-produced their internationally-known Overbeck Art Pottery in Cambridge City from 1911–1955, noted for their [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] designs, distinctive glazes and work in the grotesque style
*'''Huddleston Farmhouse''' - The [[Huddleston Farmhouse]] Inn &amp; Museum is located right outside Cambridge City in the small village of [[Mt. Auburn]] on the National Road.  It is the eastern regional office of [[Indiana Landmarks]] and the headquarters of the Indiana National Road Association.  Cambridge City is noted for its abundance in historic architecture, specifically in the Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles.  Famous structures include Rose Hill, the Conklin-Montgomery House, the Overbeck-Mattheis House, the Meredith-Rice House, the Bertsch House (home of the town's resident physician James Bertsch, D.O.), the Scheilder/Biser House, the Demwiddle-Mattingly House, the Martin Funk-Johnson House, the Fowler House, and many more.
*'''Vinton House''' - The Vinton House of Cambridge City is a former hotel that was established in 1847. This building sits at the former intersection of the National Road (U.S 40) and the Whitewater Canal. The canal's turnaround basin rested just a few feet from the Vinton House's rear door, which brought in passengers and goods from Cincinnati.

During the 1990s, members of Cambridge City's historic preservation group Western Wayne Heritage, Inc. purchased the famous Vinton House hotel.  Built in the 1840s to accommodate travelers on the newly opened Whitewater Canal and the National Road, Aaron Reisor opened the three-story hostelry on the Canal bank to run what at the time was one of Indiana's most opulent facilities.  Founded in 1984, Western Wayne Heritage, Inc. has been instrumental in promoting the history and culture of the Cambridge City area during the recent antique-history tourist boom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The Montgomery-Whitewater Chapter of the Indiana Junior Historical Society is located in Cambridge City and is sponsored by Lori Griffin, who was named by Mark Helmsing of the Indiana Council for History Education as an outstanding sponsor.

==History==

Centerville was platted in 1814 on land that once belonged to the [[Miami Indians]] and was settled by [[Quakers]] from Carolina and [[Virginia]]. A little known &quot;[[war]]&quot; was fought in [[Wayne County, Indiana]] in 1873 between Centerville and [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]]. The county seat was originally located in Centerville (Center Township). By 1870, Richmond (Wayne Township) had surpassed Centerville in business, population, and tax revenue. These factors led the population of Wayne Township to demand the county seat be moved to Richmond. The dispute was played out in the newspapers, courts, and petitions with Richmond the eventual winner.
A new courthouse was erected in Richmond and preparations were made to move records from Centerville to Richmond. Centerville stopped Richmond’s officials’ efforts to move the records twice. Once with locked gates with guards and the second by firing on their own courthouse with a three-pound [[cannon]] nicknamed “Black Betty.” The cannon was used when Richmond guards were brought in to protect the records. The cannon had been loaded with iron scraps. A crowd demanded the guard come out of the Centerville courthouse. When they refused, the cannon was fired, the door blown off its hinges, and the guards were forced to beat a hasty retreat&lt;ref&gt;Spahr, W. E. (1966). &quot;Center Township Library, Centerville, Indiana&quot;.&gt;[ http://www.waynet.org/waynet/spotlight/2001/011126-war.htm] Retrieved July 18, 2010, from Waynet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Soldiers were brought in the next day to move the records to Richmond. Centerville’s tenure as county seat had come to an end.
 
The holes from the cannon shot are still visible over the door of the old courthouse, now the Center Township Library.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1828, the National Road, Main Street, was surveyed and later became the first improved section of the trail in 1850 by a Special Act of the [[U.S. Congress]].

Centerville's [[cobblestone]] [[street]] was a major stop along the trail to the West. During the height of the [[Gold Rush]], 49,000 wagons would travel along the street each year.

Centerville is known as the “City of Arches” due to the five main [[arches]] it has located on the Old National Road. The road used to be 100 feet wide, but was shortened to 65 feet due to the people of Centerville adding on to the front of the businesses and houses. The arches were used as a way to get behind the buildings and into the backyards of the houses&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Centerville, Indiana: The city of arches&quot;. (2008, March 10). [http://pwda.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/PWDA.woa/wa/page?id=7609&amp;name=areaCENTERVILLE] Retrieved July 16, 2010, from The Lantz House and Gathering Place Inn. &lt;/ref&gt;. The five arches that are located in Centerville are the Backenstoes Archway, Dill Archway, Shortridge Archway, Lantz Archway, and Malone Archway. They were all built between 1823 and 1836&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Centerville, Indiana&quot; . (2010).[http://www.waynet.org/community/centerville/default.htm].Retrieved July 16, 2010, from Waynet: Community Network Association.&lt;/ref&gt;.They are all located on [[National Road]] in Centerville. In August, Centerville has Archway Days, which is held in celebration and honor of the historical archways. They have food, games, and prizes, which attracts people from all over the state.

==History==
Whitewater has the distinction of being &quot;incorporated&quot; which means, unlike other towns its size, that there actually is a town board, and although it is a very small community it still has street lights and sidewalks.  

The last business in Whitewater was Wolf's Union 76 gas station.  It consisted of a small garage and two gas pumps that were bordering Whitewater Road.  It closed in May 1992.

The general store is still standing though it has not been in business for many years.  It is at the corner of Whitewater Road and 227.  

The barber shop was auctioned off and razed in 1995; it had been abandoned for quite some time.

There is an old apartment building that has been empty for over 30 years and was used primarily for leather storage.  As of June 2007 the building is undergoing a renovation process.

A popular hangout for the children of Whitewater was the old iron bridge on Whitewater Road.  A sinkhole formed in the wood flooring of the bridge in the late 1990s, and it was blocked off for many months.  During this time vehicles bypassed the barricades and continued driving over the bridge.  Eventually permanent barricades were bolted to the bridge to prevent vehicles from crossing.  Many local farmers drove through the creek underneath the bridge during this time.  A new bridge was eventually put into place by 1998, and the road was drastically leveled on either side.  

Though not in the actual town of Whitewater, at the end of Whitewater Road an Amish Grocery store opened up in the late summer of 2006.  The area had not had a grocery store in many years and had to depend on the nearby town of Richmond for all shopping.  The store became very popular with the people of Whitewater, and nearby Fountain City and Bethel.  The store now carries a wide array of everyday items, and a complete deli.

Bluffton is one of the first towns in Indiana, and across [[United States|America]], to both publicly acknowledge its history of exclusion and to promote itself as an inclusive town.

The plank road was a toll road; any horse or horse-drawn vehicle had to pay a toll. The Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, &amp; Louisville Railroad was built through Ossian in 1869, though it was not in complete operation until the following year. Today, the railroad is a significant north-south route for the [[Norfolk Southern Corporation]]. Ossian is still served by [[Indiana State Road 1]], while four miles north is [[Interstate 469]], the beltway around [[Fort Wayne]], and also just seven miles south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]].

==Economy==
Ossian has always been an industrial town. The businesses of yesterday have given way to modern establishments in recent decades. The town industrial park is home to engineering and manufacturing companies producing materials such as tool and die, plastic gas tanks, and import of bath fixtures, just to name a few. Ossian is also surrounded by agriculture, the most important piece of [[Indiana]]'s economy.

==School District==
Northern Wells Community Schools serves northern [[Wells County, Indiana|Wells County]], including the town of Ossian. The district operates four schools; Ossian Elementary, Lancaster Elementary, Norwell Middle School, and [[Norwell High School (Indiana)|Norwell High School]].It also operates a private school called '''Bethlehem Lutheran School''' which can be found on the east side of the town.

==History==
[[Image:Monon Connection Museum sign.png|thumb|left|The Monon Connection Museum north of the town.]]
The town of Monon was platted by James Brooks in 1853 as &quot;New Bradford&quot;. This act by the president of the New Albany and Salem Railroad (predecessor of the [[Monon Railroad]]) foretold the story of the town. The town would grow as the train company prospered, but once &quot;The Monon&quot; declined, so would the town's economy.

The town's name is derived from the names of two creeks nearby, the Big Monon and the Little Monon. The spelling of the name of the creeks was formerly Monong, a [[Potawatomi]] word which one authority says meant &quot;swift-running&quot;. In the 1940s, the town's name was used as a nickname for the railroad company, and in 1956 the company formally adopted it as its corporate name.[http://www.monon.monon.org/bygone/monon.html] The first post office was established in 1838 under the name Monon,[http://www.brookston.lib.in.us/WhiteCo/chxiii.htm], and when the town was incorporated in 1879, it legally adopted the post office's name as the town's name.[http://www.brookston.lib.in.us/WhiteCo/chxxvi.htm]

The town of Monon is situated on an important junction of different branches of the Monon trains. The northern division came into Monon and turned ninety degrees heading south to [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Another line comes from [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] and turned east. Another line headed north to [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]].[http://www.monon.monon.org/bygone/monon.html]

In its heyday, the Monon Railroad had two train yards in Monon. The main yard was 11 tracks wide with a capacity for 270 cars. The South Yard was narrower, 5 tracks wide, but longer and had a 278-car capacity.

However, today, all passenger train services have closed, as has the line to Indianapolis and most of the line to Michigan City. The only trains through Monon now are a [[CSX Transportation]] line from [[Maynard, Indiana]] to Lafayette and another on a portion of the old Michigan City line.[http://pages.prodigy.net/bote_rail/Contents.html#Chicago]

==Education==
The North White School Corporation (which also serves [[Buffalo, Indiana|Buffalo]] and [[Reynolds, Indiana|Reynolds]]) govern the three public schools in Monon: Monon Elementary, North White Middle School and North White High School.

==Notable Sports History==
North White High School &quot;Vikings&quot; football coach Jim Davis led the Vikings to an undefeated 14-0 season and class 1A football state championship in 1994 by defeating Sheridan High School 34-7 at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.  The Vikings were class 1A football state runner-up in 1998 under Davis.

==Monon Food Fest==

The Monon Food Fest is held during the first Saturday in June every year. The Rail Citys Cruisers have a huge car show with awards given out for a wide range of classes. There is a wide variety of vendors there with both food and items for sale. There is also live entertainment and pony rides.

==Transportation==

Monon was once a growing railroad town with a convergence of several railway lines carrying cargo and passengers throughout major parts of Indiana. The old 11-track yard is now just overgrown foundation.

The town is located at the intersection of [[U.S. Highway 421]] and [[Indiana state highways|state road]] 16. US Highway 421 runs north to Michigan City and south to Indianapolis.

==Future==
The town is trying to pass plans that would include a new downtown area that they believe would attract more visitors and more people to live in the town.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==History==
[[File:Monticello church damages 1974 Super Outbreak.jpg|thumb|Destructed Presbyterian Church during the Super Outbreak]]
Monticello, Indiana sustained serious damage by a [[tornado]] on April 3, 1974, part the [[Super Outbreak]] that caused death and destruction across the midwest and south.&lt;ref name=NWS&gt;{{Cite Web
|url= http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/?n=superoutbreak
|title= The Monticello Tornado
|author= Northern Indiana Office
|publisher= [[National Weather Service]]
|date= 
|accessdate= 2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of this storm is recorded in the Herald Journal's book, ''Killer Tornado''. The tornado was classified as an F4 on the [[Fujita scale]] (now EF5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]]). This storm killed eight people and was part of [[tornado family]] that killed 18, causing an estimated $100 million in damage&lt;ref name=NWS/&gt;. The local paper said the aftermath was similar to a [[World War II]] bombing.

Monticello was dealt a serious blow on September 2, 2005, when Jordan Manufacturing burned down. The company manufactured outdoor furniture such as folding chairs, umbrellas, and seat cushions. Due to the materials used in making these products, four city blocks were contaminated with toxins. The blaze was large enough to require firefighters from 7 surrounding communitites to battle it and needed close to &quot;3000 gallons of water per minute for the first three hours of the blaze.&quot; (Herald Journal Weekend Edition of September 3–4-5, 2005)  While such a fire might not be a big event for a larger city, this event had a profound impact on Monticello, as Jordan Manufacturing was one of the few manufacturing plants left in the city after a [[recession]] in the 2000s.

== Twin Lakes School Corporation ==
Twin Lakes School Corporation is the school system in Monticello. The Schools are Eastlawn (elementary), Oaklawn (elementary), Meadowlawn (elementary), Woodlawn (elementary), Roosevelt Jr. High School, and Twin Lakes Sr. High School.

The High School was totaled in the 1974 tornado and had to be rebuilt. During construction, students attended classes first in local churches and then in portable units that were set up close to the high school until the main High School building could be completed.

==Tourism==

Monticello's location between Lakes Shafer and Freeman and the proximity of Indiana Beach allow for a thriving tourism industry that plays a significant role in the city's economy.  Although recreational options are geared primarily towards summer activities, the lakes are used throughout the year for fishing. Golfing and boating are available as three season sports.  Additionally, Monticello has areas for cross country skiing, snowmobiling and ice skating in the winter.

==Dining==

Monticello offers several dining options.  There are fast food chain restaurants and locally owned establishments. Sublette's Ribs, The Sportsman Inn, Riverside, Marmolijo's Trio, Beaver Pub, Anglers and the Indiana Beach Skyroom Restaurant are the most frequently cited as &quot;best&quot; in polls conducted by local newspapers.  Abe's, Arni's, Pizza King and Rocky's are all locally owned/operated pizza restaurants. There are three Chinese restaurants and two Mexican restaurants. Esmerelda's Pancake House and USA Restaurant offer breakfast as does Johns' Beach Bakery (located at the entrance to Indiana Beach).

==Entertainment==

Monticello is home to one of the few surviving drive-in movie theatres in Indiana. It is called Lake Shore Drive-In and has two movie screens playing (in total) 4 movies a night during the spring and summer months in Monticello. On Sunday mornings, a Protestant church service is offered.

The lakes and campgrounds are popular tourist destinations, but the most well-known is [[Indiana Beach]]. This amusement resort hosts up to 1,000,000 visitors each year and is home to the Hoosier Hurricane, Cornball Express, Superstition Mountain, Tig'rr, Galaxy and Steel Hawg roller coasters. The boardwalk is home to carnival type games, food stands and specialty shops. The Shafer Queen, a paddle wheel excursion boat, offers scenic lake cruises.

The Madam Carroll, docked on Lake Freeman, offers scenic lake cruises with live entertainment.  Dinner cruises are also held on certain dates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madamcarroll.com/MadC.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
During the summer, various [[fishing tournament]]s are held on Monticello's twin lakes&amp;mdash;[[Lake Freeman|Freeman]] and [[Lake Shafer|Shafer]]. Lake Shafer's shores are used as a [[campsite|campground]]. Indiana Beach is also located on this lake.

Monticello is the title and subject of a song in the musical Edges by Pasek and Paul.

==BioTown, USA==
[[Image:BioTown USA.png|left|150px]]
In 2005, the Indiana State Department of Agriculture began a program to make Reynolds an energy self-sufficient community, able to subsist almost entirely on locally produced alternative energy.  Called &quot;BioTown, USA&quot;, the pilot project involved converting local vehicles to run on [[ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] fuels and converting animal waste into electricity and natural gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehj.com/main.asp?SectionID=9&amp;SubSectionID=32&amp;ArticleID=12008|author=Lietz, Abby|title=BioTown boom!|publisher=Herald Journal|date=2005-09-14|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds was selected to become BioTown, USA because of its size, its easy accessibility by road and by rail, and its proximity to both large-scale livestock farms and to [[Purdue University]] (Purdue is located in West Lafayette, Indiana).

==Reynolds Town Festival==

A tradition that started 4 years in September, now every year the town of Reynolds rolls out the red carpet to fun.  Activities at the festival include a parade, live music, car show, multiple vendors from the surrounding community, and the softball classic.  During the time the streets of Reynolds are shut to down cars and opened up for pedestrians and 4-wheelers.
The night is always capped off by a beautiful fireworks display. After the fireworks expect an appearance from Jordon Zile, the famous Opossum.

==History==
[[Image:Churubusco Indiana 1889 Plat Map.png|thumb|150px|left|An 1889 plat map of Churubsuco showing the first two towns, &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Franklin.&quot;]]
Originally, the area of Churubusco was made up of two towns founded in the 19th century by European Americans: Union (in honor of the union victory of the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]]) and Franklin (in honor of the [[founding father]], [[Benjamin Franklin]]) that bordered each other across a railroad track. In the 1840s, the populations of both Franklin and Union grew large enough to qualify each for a [[post office]]. Before that time, residents of both towns had to trek 11 miles by foot or horse and buggy to nearby [[Columbia City, Indiana|Columbia City]] to get their mail.  Since the towns were in the same location, the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] ordered the towns to apply for a joint post office.  The Postmaster General denied the use of either &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; as the new post office name, since both were already used by other Indiana towns.

After a community meeting, the residents selected [[Churubusco]] for the new post office, named after the site of the 1847 [[Battle of Churubusco]], in [[Mexico]] during the [[Mexican-American War]].  At the time, after the suggestion of local school teacher Eliza Rich, the townsfolk thought it was as patriotic a name as Union and Franklin, since the United States won a large victory there.  More importantly, they were certain no other Indiana town would already have chosen such a unique name.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Kaler and R. H. Maring, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=-hUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA860&amp;dq=churubusco+indiana&amp;lr=&amp;ei=cBiTSbffOKSayATmjtnPCA#PPA296,M1 Whitley County Indiana]'', B.F. Bowen &amp; Co., 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Churubusco'' is a [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] corruption of an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Nahuatl]] [[toponym]] (place name) referring to a temple area celebrating the [[Aztec]] god ''[[Huitzilopochtli]]''.  It is bordered by the [[Rio Churubusco]] in [[Mexico City]].  The Spanish-Nahuatl word literally translates as &quot;place of the hummingbirds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/0820/082097.opin.opin.1.html Howard LaFranchi, &quot;How the Southwest was won&quot;], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 20 Aug 1997, accessed 9 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and government==
Churubusco has an elected [[town clerk|clerk]] and [[town council]]-style government. The Churubusco Town Council is a three-member legislative group that serve four-year terms; each are elected town-wide as at-large council members. The council elects one member from among its body to act a president of the council. That president sets agendas during council meetings. The current council members were elected on November 6, 2007, and will serve until December 31, 2011&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071106/ELECTION02/711070305/-1/ELECTION|Election Results: WHITLEY COUNTY]'', ''[[Fort Wayne Journal Gazette]]'', November 6, 2007.

==Notable natives and former residents==

* [[Janie Fricke]], country music artist, was born in South Whitley in 1947.
* [[Will Cuppy]] (1884–1949), humorist and journalist, spent summers when he was a boy at the farm of his grandmother, Sarah Collins Cuppy, near South Whitley.  Sarah Collins Cuppy on the other hand, with her husband, ran a station on the underground railroad.  The house still exits today on St. Rd. 5 through the main strip of South Whitley.  Many secret passages and hidden rooms exist within the walls of the old house.  The doors of the home are not open to the public and the home is privately owned.  {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;George Morrison Fleck, The Cuppy House, South Whitley, IN: Fleck Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note of interest==
* [[Trivial Pursuit]], the game introduced in 1982, had a question concerning this small town and its annual festival, in particular the bed races.  Gripco, a nut and bolt factory that employed many of the townspeople, sponsored most of the events in the Fall Festival, culminating in the bed races in which four people push a bed on wheels down the main street of town with one person riding on the bed.  The game cited South Whitley as the bed race capitol of the United States.
*The Whitko High School basketball team of 1990–1991 advanced to the final four of the [[Hoosier Hysteria|state tournament]], losing in the semifinal game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihsaa.org/b-basketball_frame.htm IHSAA State Finals Scores&lt;/ref&gt; This feat was accomplished when the state tournament was open to all schools, before class basketball was instated.
*The Whitko High School football team of 1986 advanced to the class 2A state finals, where they defeated Tell City 26 to 0 to win the state championship.  The victory is, as of the 2009–2010 athletic season, Whitko's only state championship.
*The largest employer for the city is Shindigz which has been in business since 1926.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shindigz.com/service.cfm?page=about_us About Shindigz&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adair''' is a city in [[Adair County, Iowa|Adair]] and [[Guthrie County, Iowa|Guthrie]] Counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Iowa]]. The population was 839 at the 2000 census.

The Guthrie County portion of Adair is part of the [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]&amp;ndash;[[West Des Moines, Iowa|West Des Moines]] [[Des Moines metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
The [[Rock Island Railroad]] was built through the area in 1868. This led to the area being known as Summit Cut. This is in reference to the ridge that forms the watershed divide between the [[Missouri River]] and the [[Mississippi River]].  The town officially became Adair on August 20, 1872 when it was incorporated with the county.  The town is named after [[General]] [[John Adair]], a general in the [[War of 1812]] who later became the 8th governor of [[Kentucky]]. Adair was the scene of the first successful [[train robbery]] in the [[American West]] when on July 21, 1873 the [[James-Younger Gang]] (led by [[Jesse James]]) took US $3,000 from the Rock Island Express after derailing it southwest of the town. The derailment killed the engineer.

A rare [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes|F5 tornado]] occurred near this town on June 27, 1953.

Adair is recognizable from [[Interstate 80]] by its yellow &quot;smiley-face&quot; water tower.

== History ==
{{refimprove|date=February 2008}}

Carbon Iowa is located on the Nodaway River. This was home to the Pottawatomie, Oto and Iowa Indian tribes until the treaty of 1851 forced their removal to Kansas or Indian Territory now known as Oklahoma. The first settler to Carbon was Elijah Walters [http://incolor.inetnebr.com/rgcox/adamhist.htm] in 1849. He reported seeing huts, old camp fires but stated that the tribes had moved on, only to see an occasional &quot;red man&quot; appear and look over old camp sites and burial sites then move on. Elijah built a mill on the Nodaway river that became a great social center of its time.  Carbon is also known for its coal mines. The heyday of the Carbon coal mines lasted approx. 75yrs beginning in the late 1800s and ending in the early 1900s. Carbon has always been known as a lawless town for those that like to fight. Many a gun fight did take place in the streets when the coal mine era was booming. Until 1998 The only water supply was on what is now called the &quot;pump road&quot; Where on the edge of a gravel road sits an old hand pump. The pump has stood for over 100yrs. Horse drawn wagons would carry ice from the river and water from the pump back to town. Only one home with in the Carbon city limits had a well until the late 1990s when rural water was finely piped in.  As of this writing in 2008, Carbon still stands as a place time forgot.  A place that people come to feel miles away from civilization, and they are.

'''Corning''' is a city in [[Quincy Township, Adams County, Iowa|Quincy Township]], [[Adams County, Iowa|Adams County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,783 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Adams County, Iowa|Adams County]]{{GR|6}}.

Corning is perhaps best known as the birthplace of [[Johnny Carson]].  [[Daniel Webster Turner]], who was governor of Iowa from 1931 to 1933, was born in Corning on March 17, 1877.

== History ==
=== French Icarian settlement ===
The first European settlers here were a group of [[French people|French]] [[Icarians]] who came from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] in 1852; they established a community near Lake Icaria, north of Corning in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Communist |last=Mutual Aid Community |volume=1 |year=1868 |publisher=The Mutual Aid Community |location= |isbn= |page=87 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xZwWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 |accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new state of Iowa gave the town of &quot;Icaria&quot; a corporate charter in 1860. This community was dedicated to the utopian principles of [[Etienne Cabet]] and the democratic principles of the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]]; this small French-speaking community considered themselves to be very patriotic Americans. In the 1860s, the community split between &quot;traditionalists&quot; and &quot;progressives&quot; (the latter favored women's right to vote). The &quot;progressives&quot; left the original site and moved to a new location about three miles (5 km) east of Corning's current location. Although the corporation formally dissolved in 1878, some continued to live in the communal dwellings until 1898, making this the longest-lasting Icarian colony in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;nihs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=History of the Icarian Movement
|publisher=National Icarian Heritage Society
|date=2006
|accessdate=2007-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the community disbanded and merged into the general population. Displays and documents about the Icarian community can be found at the Icarian History Foundation office and in the Adams County offices, both in Corning. The former colony east of Corning is slowly being restored with the help of state and federal grants, and it will become a historical site; as of 2006, only a couple of partially-restored building and a very small cemetery (with grave markers inscribed in French) remain. Around the first weekend of June each year, Corning celebreates ''&quot;Le Festival De L'Heritage Francais&quot;'' in the French market.&lt;ref name=&quot;fete&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=== American settlement ===

Nearby [[Queen City, Iowa|Queen City]] had been established around 1854. Surveyors came to the current location of Corning in 1857, though the area was largely uninhabited (except by the Icarians) until 1869.

The first Adams County seat was established by act of the Iowa Legislature on January 12, 1853, at Quincy (now nonexistent) Iowa. The building was later used as a schoolhouse and in 1932 it was torn down. In November, 1872, the people voted to remove the courthouse from Quincy and locate the county seat in Corning. (As the story goes the vote was more an overtaking. A group of men took a team of horses with a wagon from Corning to Quincy.) The mayor's house was burned to the ground leaving the mayor/doctor for dead. Others that held documents in their homes were forced at gun point to surrender those documents. They were then taken to Corning were the new county seat was established.)&lt;ref name=&quot;adamscounty&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|title=Adams County web site
|url=http://adamscountyia.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first courthouse in Corning was built in 1872 at the present site of the Adams County courthouse. It was also a wood frame structure. The county jail was built in 1877 and used until 1955. This courthouse was destroyed by fire on February 1, 1888. Business buildings in Corning   then served as temporary quarters for the county offices. On November 5, 1889, Adams County voters approved a bond issue not to exceed $30,000 for construction of a new courthouse. Money was to be raised by taxation of not to exceed 2 mills on the dollar each year.  The new courthouse was dedicated on June 20, 1890.  Barely 40 years later, this building, called one of the most modern in the country with its Queen Anne style of architecture, began to deteriorate and was razed in 1955.

==Sports==
Corning is home to Adams County Speedway, which holds races on Saturday nights from April through September. Adams County Speedway is a part of the [[Whelen All-American Series]], with Late Models, Modifieds, Pro Streets, and Hobby Stocks.

Corning is also home to the Carnac Family Skatepark, A {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. skatepark built with donated money.  Major donations included $75,000 from Corning native Johnny Carson, and $5,000 from well known skateboarder Tony Hawk.  The skatepark is known as one of the best in the area, and draws big summer crowds.

'''Postville''' is a city in [[Allamakee County, Iowa|Allamakee]] and [[Clayton County, Iowa|Clayton]] Counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Iowa]].  It lies near the junction of four counties and at the intersection of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 18|18]] and [[U.S. Route 52|52]] and [[Iowa Highway 51]], with airport facilities in the neighboring communities of Waukon, Decorah, Monona, and Prairie du Chien. The population was 2,273 at the 2000 census.  The city is located in the southwestern corner of Allamakee County and the northwestern corner of Clayton County in a quad county or four corner region where four counties meet in the same spot.  [[Winneshiek County, Iowa|Winneshiek County]] is just to the west, and [[Fayette County, Iowa|Fayette County]] is located just to the southwest of Postville.

==History==
The population of Postville was predominantly [[German-American|German]] and [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian]] for much of its existence. In 1987, a group of [[Hasidic]] Jews of the [[Lubavitch]] movement from New York purchased a non-[[Kosher]] slaughterhouse&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kosher slaughterhouse owners surrounded by scandal.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', August 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, refurbished it according to Hasidic Law and named the facility [[Agriprocessors]], which filed for bankruptcy on November 5, 2008 following a series of alleged violations of labor law and repeated accusations of mistreatment of cattle. The facility was [[Postville Raid|raided]] by the federal government in 2008, resulting in hundreds of arrests and disruption to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration Raid Jars a Small Town. ''Washington Post'', http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/17/AR2008051702474_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction of long time Postville residents with newcomers was the subject of a book about the town, ''[[Postville: A Clash of Cultures in Heartland America]]'' (ISBN 0-15-100652-0), written by [[Stephen Bloom]], a professor at the [[University of Iowa]].

A more recent book about the community and its experience with diversity before and after the May 2008 federal immigration raid is ''[[Postville USA: Surviving Diversity in Small-Town America]]'' written by Mark Grey, Michele Devlin and Aaron Goldsmith. [http://www.postvilleusa.com]

Postville was also the boyhood home of 1946 Nobel laureate [[John R. Mott]].

==Economy==
Postville's growth during the last 15 years has been due to the presence of two large meat processing plants, [[Agriprocessors]] and Iowa Turkey Products. Agriprocessors, the [[kosher]] meat plant, is the largest of its type in the world, which as of February 2008 employed about 900 people and purchased $100 million worth of livestock annually. In May 2008, Agriprocessors was the target of a federal [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postville_Raid|publisher=Wikipedia|title=Postville Raid|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a criminal complaint was filed against Agriprocessors and its principal for alleged violations of [[child labor]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/14/postville.raid/index.html Mayor: Feds turned my town 'topsy turvy']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iowa Turkey Products, which burned in December 2003, was another major employer in the community. The plant has since rebuilt in [[Marshall, Minnesota|Marshall]], [[Minnesota]]. Postville is also the home of a plastics factory, [[Norplex]]. The Norplex factory produces laminated plastics plate, sheet, and profile shapes and as of 2007 employs between 250 to 500 workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://start.cortera.com/company/research/k2j6jys1p/norplex-oak-inc/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centerville''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Appanoose County, Iowa|Appanoose County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 5,924 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].  After the turn of the 20th century Centerville had a booming [[coal mining]] industry that attracted many European immigrants. The city today remains the home of many [[Swedish-Americans]], [[Italian-Americans]], [[Croatian-Americans]], [[Albanian-Americans]] and others descended from immigrants who worked in the mines. 

== History ==
Founded in 1846 by Jonathon Stratton under the name of &quot;Chaldea,&quot; the city was planned around a unique two-block long city square. The name was later changed to Senterville, named after [[Dewitt Clinton Senter]], a prominent [[Tennessee]] politician.  When [[Incorporation (municipal government)|incorporation]] papers were filed in 1855, someone mistook the name for a misspelling and corrected it to Centerville.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Savage, [http://books.google.com/books?id=DxagLIZHNv4C&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;pg=PA52 A Dictionary of Iowa Place Names], University of Iowa Press, 2007; page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A mining town ===
[[Image:CentervilleMines.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Centerville area from 1908, showing the railroads and shipping coal mines (shown in red) of the region. Centerville is in the lower right quadrant. Smaller mines that did not ship by rail are not shown.]]
The first [[coal mine]] in Centerville was opened in 1868, with its [[mine shaft]] about one-half mile from the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] depot.  Horse-power was used to raise coal from the mines until 1872, when the Watson Coal Company opened a mine equipped with a steam [[hoist (mining)|hoist]].  The Centerville Block Coal Company, organized in 1894, consolidated the operation of numerous mines in the region to become the dominant mining company.  In 1914, Centerville Block Coal produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state.  Centerville Block's largest competitor, formed around the same time, was the Scandinavian Coal Company, organized by a group of Swedish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Lees, History of Coal Mining in Iowa, Chapter III of [http://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;pg=PA536 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 536-537&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Saward, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NO8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 The Coal Trade, 1915], page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1938, coal production in the Centerville region was 600,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;WPA Federal Writers Project, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ciAJzN6CqiEC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;pg=PA540 IOWA Guide to the Hawkeye State], State Historical Society of Iowa and Hastings House, 1938 and 1949, page 540&lt;/ref&gt;  The mines were in the Mystic coal bed, 125 feet below ground in Centerville but exposed at the surface in [[Mystic, Iowa|Mystic]], 5 miles to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Wilder, James H. Lees and A. W. Hixton, Fuel Value of Iowa Coals with Analyses of Iowa Coals, Chapter II of [http://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;pg=PA408 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 408&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RelayMineNo3.jpg|thumb|300px|The upper works of the Relay Mine No. 3, circa 1908.]]
Centerville Block Coal's Relay Mine Number 3 was located on the west side of town (Number 31 on the map).  By 1908, the coal face was a mile from the base of the shaft.  Mules were used to haul trains of loaded coal tubs to the main haulage way, where they were hauled by a continuous loop of cable the last half mile to the shaft.  The coal seam here was about 3 feet thick, and the shaft was 107 feet deep.  A centrifugal blower 12 feet in diameter provided ventilation, and compressed air was used to power mining machinery.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Fultz, [http://books.google.com/books?id=nor-ORf44sMC&amp;pg=PA97 Out of Door Studies in Geography, I, The Making of the Surface and Soils of the Upper Mississippi Region], The Public School Publishing Co., Bloomington Ill., 1916, Copyright 1908; see chapter V, An Iowa Coal Mine, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual Report, 1908&quot;&gt;Henry Hinds, The Coal Deposits of Iowa, [http://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;pg=PA277 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the Scandinavian Coal Company drilled a 550 foot exploratory hole in Centerville, discovering a deposit of [[gypsum]] and [[anhydrite]] 10 feet thick near the bottom.  The Centerville Gypsum Company was formed to exploit this deposit, and between 1912 and 1913, the company bored a shaft down to the gypsum.  Water problems delayed the opening of the mine until 1917, and commercial production began in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Kay, Gypsum at Centerville, [http://books.google.com/books?id=mqoPAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;pg=PA107 Gypsum Deposits of the United States], United States Geologic Survey Bulletin 697, 1920, pages 107-109.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mine was closed in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. McKay, [http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/gypsum/gypsum.htm Gypsum Resources of Iowa], Iowa Geological Survey, adapted from Iowa Geology, 1985, No. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sunshine mine, about 3 miles west of Centerville (number 30 on the map), was very small in 1908, with just a horse-powered [[Hoist (mining)|hoist]] at the pit head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual Report, 1908&quot;/&gt;  By the 1930s, this was a large mine with an attached mining camp and a mountain of mine waste 500 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ortho.gis.iastate.edu/client.cgi?zoom=0.5&amp;x0=506015&amp;y0=4509723&amp;layer=ortho_1930&amp;action=zoomout&amp;pwidth=600&amp;pheight=450&amp;x=307&amp;y=216 1930's Aerial Photos] taken by the [[USDA]] on the [http://ortho.gis.iastate.edu/ Iowa Geographic Map Server].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sunshine Mine Drive-In is a [[Drive-in theater|theater]] on the former mine site that opened in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drive-ins.com/theater/iatsuns&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The post-coal era ===
Centerville experienced its peak [[population]] in the early 1900s as the popularity of [[coal]] peaked. After that point, as usage dwindled, the coal [[industry]] that had been the community's life blood collapsed. In the 1950s and 1960s a civic movement to promote new industries began. This effort culminated in the building of Rathbun Dam, near the city of [[Rathbun, Iowa]], forming Rathbun Lake, known as &quot;Iowa's Ocean&quot;, that was dedicated on July 31, 1971 by President [[Richard M. Nixon]].  

Today the city is supported by several small industrial plants, mostly in the area of [[plastic]] products. In June 2006 the Centerville Daily Iowegian reported that the city's largest employer, a [[Rubbermaid]] plant, that opened in Centerville in 1985, would shut down in September 2006 displacing 500 workers. In 2007, the former Rubbermaid building was purchased by [[Lee Container Corp.]] of [[Homerville, Georgia]], and is planned to be re-opened in 2008.  Lee Container is a manufacturer of H.D.P.E. blow molded containers for crop protection-, lubricant-, pet care-, beverage-, specialty- and household products.  The city (and county) is also served by several other manufacturing operations, including Curwood, a [[Bemis Company]], a major supplier of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials used by leading food, consumer products, manufacturing, and other companies worldwide.  The [[Barker Company]], of [[Keosauqua, Iowa]] that manufactures many lines of refrigerated, non-refrigerated and hot display cases for the supermarket, convenience store and food service industries located a manufacturing plant in Centerville in 1998. 

As county seat, Centerville had a thriving retail sector, serving people from smaller communities and [[farms]] in the area as well as local residents. Many shops were located around the [[Courthouse Square Historic District (Iowa)|Courthouse Square Historic District]], which has hundreds of parking spaces between the shops' [[sidewalks]] and the courthouse lawn—in effect, six-lane wide streeting around the [[Appanoose County Courthouse]] provides four lanes of public parking. In the latter decades of the 20th century, Centerville, like many other small American communities, experienced a change in its retail economy as many long-established locally owned shops closed, due in large part to loss of business to large nationally owned retailers. Many of the former stores have been replaced by specialty gift shops and antique stores, catering to tourists as well as locals. 

In 1999, the Lake Center Mall was destroyed by an act of arson. The entire site sat unoccupied until a cineplex and a [[Pizza Ranch]] were built there in the early 2000s.

In 1984, the [[Appanoose County Community Railroad]] was formed out of discarded pieces of the Wabash and Rock Island lines to maintain a rail link to the outside world. Forming the railroad helped to bring [[Rubbermaid]] to the city.

Since the 1990s, Centerville has focused on quality-of-life issues in an attempt to attract and keep young families in the area. A new emphasis on the arts, culture and local history has emerged, culminating in the Townscape project to beautify the [[Courthouse Square Historic District (Iowa)|Courthouse Square Historic District]].

==Geography==
Centerville is located at {{Coord|40|43|47|N|92|52|19|W|type:city}} (40.729836, -92.872012){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 4.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (11.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 4.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (11.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.88%) is water.

'''Mystic''' is a city in [[Appanoose County, Iowa|Appanoose County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 588 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Mystic is located at {{coord|40|46|43|N|92|56|42|W|city}} (40.778616, -92.944933){{GR|1}} in the valley of Walnut Creek, about 4 miles southwest of its confluence with the [[Chariton River]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 2.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (7.6&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land.

==History==
[[Image:CentervilleMines.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Mystic and Brazil area from 1908, showing the railroads and shipping coal mines (shown in red) of the region. Mystic and Brazil are in the upper left quadrant.  Smaller mines that did not ship by rail are not shown.]]
At the end of the 19th century, &quot;the valley of Walnut Creek was one continuous mining camp, known under different names, Jerome, Diamond, '''Mystic''', Clarksdale, [[Rathbun, Iowa|Rathbun]] and Darby&quot; (later known as Darbyville).&lt;ref&gt;H. Foster Bain, Geology of Appanoose County, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HpURAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA389 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1895] Conway, Des Moines, 1896; page 389.&lt;/ref&gt;  A. M. Elgin opened the first [[coal mine]] in the Mystic area in 1857, about 1.5 miles north of Mystic on Little Walnut Creek.  The Mystic coal seam was exposed on the surface there, and [[Drift mine|drifts]] were opened and abandoned over the next few decades until the hills were honeycombed with mines.

In 1858, Isaac Fuller opened a large mine in Mystic, shipping coal for domestic use in nearby [[Centerville, Iowa|Centerville]].  In 1887, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway]] built a line through Mystic, leading to an explosive growth in mining.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Lees, History of Coal Mining in Iowa, Chapter III of [http://books.google.com/books?id=1BUMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;pg=PA534 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 534-535.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1893, there were 14 mines in Mystic and 2 in Brazil, just to the south.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PRAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA11 Sixth Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspector to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the Two Years Ending June 30, 1893], Ragsdale, Des Moines, 1893 ,page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noteworthy that the terms ''brass'', ''brazzle'' and ''brazil'' are English dialect terms for [[pyrite]] or to coal seams with significant pyrite content&lt;ref&gt;Julia A. Jackson, James Mehl and Klaus Neuendorf, [http://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;pg=PA82  Glossary of Geology], American Geological Institute, 2005; page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a shale layer not far above the Mystic coal seam in Mystic and Brazil contains significant pyrite.&lt;ref&gt;H. Foster Bain, Geology of Appanoose County, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HpURAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA389 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1895] Conway, Des Moines, 1896; page 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the Lodwick Brothers Coal Company of Mystic produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Saward, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NO8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 The Coal Trade, 1915], page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Numa''' is a city in [[Appanoose County, Iowa|Appanoose County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 109 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Numa is located at {{coord|40|41|8|N|92|58|43|W|city}} (40.685566, -92.978596){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 0.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (1.1&amp;nbsp;km²), all of it land.

==History==
[[Image:CentervilleMines.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Numa area from 1908, showing the railroads and shipping coal mines (in red) of the region. Numa is in the lower left corner.  Smaller mines that did not ship by rail are not shown.]]
In 1907, fire destroyed the surface equipment of the Numa Block mine, at the time, the most productive mine in the county.  The Numa Block shaft was 150 feet deep, giving access to a 30-inch coal seam.  The Numa Block Coal Company also owned mines in [[Seymour, Iowa]] (about 8 miles to the west).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hinds, The Coal Deposits of Iowa, [http://books.google.com/books?id=zPbUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA280 Annual Report, 1908], Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, pages 260, 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Numa Block mine was closed in 1915, after having undermined 240 acres.  In 1911, the Numa Block Coal Company started a new mine, about a mile east of Numa.  When fully developed, this mine employed 155 men, hoisting 300 tons of coal daily to ship 175 carloads of coal monthly.  A new [[company town]], Martinstown, was platted around this mine in 1913.  The 40 or so houses in Martinstown were frequently known as Shantytown.  The mine closed in 1937, after undermining 96 acres.  Aside from the blackened remains of the Martinstown slag pile, little remains of this mine today.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Heusinkveld, &quot;The Numa Coal Co. in Martinstown, [http://www.dailyiowegian.com/archivesearch/local_story_292101022.html The Daily Iowegian], Oct. 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, the Numa Block Coal Company produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Saward, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NO8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 The Coal Trade, 1915], page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rathbun''' is a city in [[Appanoose County, Iowa|Appanoose County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 88 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Incorporated in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=sC84AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA38 Acts and Resolutions passed at the Extra Session of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of the State of Iowa], F. R. Conway, Des Moines, 1897; page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Rathbun was established in 1892 as a mining town.
&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Taylor, [http://books.google.com/books?id=i34UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA152 Past and Present of Appanoose County Iowa, Vol. 1], S. J. Clarke, Chicago, 1913; pages 152, 416.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the 19th century, &quot;the valley of Walnut Creek was one continuous mining camp, known under different names, Jerome, Diamond, [[Mystic, Iowa|Mystic]], Clarksdale, '''Rathbun''' and Darby&quot; (later known as Darbyville)&lt;ref&gt;H. Foster Bain, Geology of Appanoose County, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HpURAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA389 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1895] Conway, Des Moines, 1896; page 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Star Coal Company of Streator, Ill. operated the Rathbun Mine, with an {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} [[mine shaft|shaft]].
